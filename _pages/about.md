Hi, I’m **Abhilash Ojha**, PhD candidate at University of Minnesota, Department of Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on cryopreservation, molecular dynamics simulations.  

Previously, I worked as a Scientist at the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)**, where I designed and tested carbon fiber antenna reflectors and carried out thermal experiments.  

My current research integrates experimental cryobiology (droplet vitrification systems) with computational modeling (molecular dynamics of ice–water–CPA systems, heat transfer in nanoclusters, and dusty plasma analogues).  

**Interests:**  
- Cryopreservation and droplet cooling systems  
- Molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS, HPC workflows)  
- Machine learning for image analysis and segmentation  
- Nanocluster heat transfer and accommodation coefficients
